# Auto-Harvest Wild Plants
A RimWorld mod that automatically marks harvestable wild plants for you.
## Description
This is a simple mod that automatically marks wild plants which are fully-grown
on the current map. Avoids marking plants in growing zones as well.

Made for people tired of constantly manually looking around the map for wild
plants to harvest.

Based on the "Allow Dead Animals" mod (https://github.com/andrew-raphael-lukasik/rimworld-mod_allow-dead-animals/)
